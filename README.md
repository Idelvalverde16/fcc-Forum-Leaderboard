# fcc-Forum-Leaderboard
Learning asynchronous programming by building an freeCodeCamp Forum Leaderboard.

JavaScript is an asynchronous programming language. And this project helped me gain proficiency in asynchronous concepts. I coded my own freeCodeCamp forum leaderboard.

This project covered the Fetch API, promises, Async/Await, and the try..catch statements.

Practicing in https://www.freecodecamp.org.
